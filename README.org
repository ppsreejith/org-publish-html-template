  A simple, customizable org publish demo

** Publishing
*** Spacemacs
    1. Access a file, for example ~./src/index.org~.
    2. Use ~, e e P p~ to publish the project. The output will be in the ~public~ folder.
** Troubleshooting
   If you're facing problems with publishing, do the following to do a clean publish.
   1. Run ~rm ./public/~ to clear the published directory.
   2. Run ~rm -rf ~/.emacs.d/.cache/.org-timestamps/~ to clear the org cache.
** New Post
   To create a new post in the folder ~src/posts/year/month/date/post-name.org~, use the following function after replacing ~/path/to/project~ with the actual path to your project.
   #+begin_src elisp
     (defun new-post ()
       ;; prompt for post name
       ;; replace spaces with dashes
       ;; prepend today's date
       ;; add .org
       ;; open file buffer
       (interactive
        (let*  ((name (read-string "Post name: " nil 'my-history))
                (posts-dir "~/path/to/project/")
                (date (format-time-string "%Y/%m/%d")))
          (find-file (concat posts-dir (downcase (format "%s/%s.org" date (replace-regexp-in-string " +" "-" name)))))
          (insert "#+INCLUDE: \"../../../../options/default-config.org\"\n")
          (insert (format "#+SUBTITLE: %s\n\n" name))
          (org-mode)
          )))
   #+end_src
